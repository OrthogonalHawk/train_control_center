# train_control_center
Simple Python PyGame running on a BeagleBone Black with the 4D Systems 4.3" LCD cape. Creates a simple, kid-friendly interface with three buttons and a rotating background image. Each button has a user configurable thumbnail image and initiates audio playback of a button-specific file.

Originally designed to be a fun interface to a cardboard box (leftover from a washing machine) train.

Thanks to Al Sweigart for his pygbutton.py module (http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/10/30/creating-a-button-ui-module-for-pygame/)
